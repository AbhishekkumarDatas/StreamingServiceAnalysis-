  ### Recommendations
   Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
  -Market Focus on English-Language Films: The dominance of English-language movies reflects either a large market demand or higher production rates for English-speaking audiences. This could guide future 
  investment and marketing strategies towards English-language content.
  -Targeting Adult Audiences: The prevalence of movies for the 18+ age group indicates that the film industry prioritizes content for adult viewers. This insight could influence content creation and distribution 
  strategies to better cater to this demographic.
  -Quality Content Recognition: The high number of movies with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes showcases the presence of a considerable amount of high-quality content. This could be used to promote and highlight 
  critically acclaimed films to attract discerning viewers.
  -Streaming Service Competition: The high ratings for Prime Video and Netflix movies on IMDb suggest intense competition between these platforms. Understanding viewer preferences and satisfaction could help 
   these services refine their content offerings and improve user experience.
